                    Welcome to my portfolio! As the world’s laziest egg and a student at the University of Central Florida, I’m majoring in electrical engineering and minoring in computer science. This website is a reflection of my unique journey, where I blend a relaxed approach to life with a passion for technology and design. Here, you’ll find a curated selection of my projects, showcasing my skills and creativity while embodying my belief that learning should be enjoyable.<br><br/>In my electrical engineering projects, I’ve focused on designing circuits and systems that not only solve problems but also spark joy. Whether it’s building a solar-powered egg boiler or a temperature-adjustable blanket, I strive to infuse a sense of playfulness into my work. Each project is an opportunity to explore new ideas while embracing the occasional nap break—after all, a well-rested mind is a creative mind! My minor in computer science allows me to bring a digital dimension to my work, where I develop applications and algorithms that enhance my engineering projects.<br><br/>I invite you to dive into my portfolio and explore the various projects that reflect my journey as a student and creator. From detailed project reports to interactive prototypes, each piece tells a story of exploration, creativity, and a touch of whimsy. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoyed creating it!
