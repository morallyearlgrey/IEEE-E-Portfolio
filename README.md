3. **Hosting Your E-Portfolio via GitHub Pages**: Once your e-portfolio is ready, you can host it online using GitHub Pages. Here’s how:

   1) **Go to Repository Settings**: Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Settings" tab.
   2) **Scroll to the GitHub Pages Section**: Scroll down to the "Pages" section.
   3) **Select the Source Branch**: Under "Source," select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually main) and choose the / (root) folder.

   5) **Access Your Site**: After a few minutes, your site should be available at https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/. Replace <username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with your repository name.


## Instructions for Uploading Fonts and Images
   **Uploading Fonts**: You can upload any custom fonts to the `fonts` folder. Ensure that the font files are in `.ttf` format.
   
   **Uploading Images**: Place your images in the `images` folder. This includes profile pictures, project images, or any other visuals you wish to display.

## Domain Hosting Other Than Github

If you don't want to host your lovely e-portfolio website on GitHub, no worries! Here are some **free hosting options** other than GitHub you can consider:

- **Netlify**: Another excellent option for hosting static sites, offering easy integration with GitHub. Netlify provides features like continuous deployment, custom domains, and free SSL certificates.

- **Vercel**: A platform that allows you to host static sites and serverless functions effortlessly. Vercel also integrates with GitHub for continuous deployment and provides a straightforward setup.

## Notes for Developers

If you intend to use this template as a reference to create your own e-portfolio website, it is highly recommended to use **React.js** for building more dynamic and responsive applications. This template was not written in React.js for simplicity and user-friendliness, making it accessible to users with varying levels of coding experience.
