// SCRIPT SHEET
/*
This is where all our backend code for our website is located! This makes those components on that pretty interface actually come to life and be able to have cool functionalities (i.e. the image carousel, the learn more button, etc)! In this section, you can modify the skills you want to showcase underneath your name, the images you want in that image carousel, and the projects you want listed

Quick Modifications Key:
Here is a list of sections you can modify/customize! Use CTRL+F or CMD+F to find these sections to modify them!

MODIFICATION SECTION: SKILLS SECTION
MODIFICATION SECTION: IMAGES SECTION
MODIFICATION SECTION: PROJECTS SECTION
MODIFICATION SECTION: EXPERIENCES SECTION
